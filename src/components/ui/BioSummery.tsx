        I&apos;m a full-stack developer and product designer who&apos;s been
        TypeScript-ing away for years, turning caffeine into code and my own
        Figma mockups into pixel-perfect reality. When I&apos;m not debugging
        (which is never), I&apos;m probably founding startups, building payment
        platforms, or explaining to my computer why it should work the first
        time.

        <strong className="font-semibold">Skills include:</strong> Building in
        React because apparently dependency injection and proper architecture
        are overrated, wrestling with databases until they surrender their data,
        and somehow convincing AWS that yes, I do know what I&apos;m doing. I
        speak fluent TypeScript, conversational PostgreSQL, and enough CSS to
        make your designer weep tears of joy (I&apos;m basically a CSS wizard,
        no big deal).

        successfully turned restaurant orders into code, invoices into secure
        platforms, and startup dreams into actual products. Currently based in
        Anacortes, WA, where the WiFi is strong and the coffee is stronger.
